Installing ecto
===============

If you have access to a ROS repository, just install the ros-ditro_name-ecto packages. E.g., if you are on Groovy:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install ros-groovy-ecto


Otherwise, ecto is still easy to build from source:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    dependencies.rst    
    get_ecto.rst

Windows support is still experimental but we had good experience with ``cygwin``:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    get_ecto_win32
